## Translate on the Go

### Inspiration
I'm always looking up words/phrases (usually en español ou em português).

(I know this is pointless since a thing called Google Translate exists, but this is a way for me to mess around with Go on something I might use at one point or another.)


### Setup:
- go install
- go build
- ./travel_go
- test it out on port 5000 (or whatever you are using)


### Routes:
- /list-languages - lists all possible languages for
- /test - responds with a 200 status (used to verify server is up and running)


### Packages:



### Resources:
